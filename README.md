# Ayo Ayco Personal Website

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/5d69b1e0-6f00-4675-a91b-d7bed43f17dc/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/ayoayco/deploys)

This is a website built with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), a static site generator in Ruby, which I customized on top of the default [Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). Customizations are mostly inspired by the [Jekyll website itself](https://jekyllrb.com). :)

### Plans to move away from Jekyll

Coming back to this Jekyll project in 2022 with an M1 Macbook Pro is a pain. This is not the first time I have had issues setting it up in different kinds of machine. Because of this I plan to move away from Jekyll for a more stable development experience.

I will continue to update content since the CI/CD pipeline is already working.

This site is moved to a new home: [classic.ayco.io](https://classic.ayco.io)

A new site, built with [Astro](https://astro.build), is now deployed to [ayco.io](https://ayco.io)
