# Ayo Ayco Personal Website

Here is the live website: [https://ayco.io/](https://ayco.io/)

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/5d69b1e0-6f00-4675-a91b-d7bed43f17dc/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/ayoayco/deploys)

This is a blog built with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), a static site generator in Ruby, which I customized on top of the default [Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). Customizations are mostly inspired by the [Jekyll website itself](https://jekyllrb.com). :)

Later, I will do a fork of Minima theme and publish my customizations.

# Plans to move away from Jekyll

Coming back to this Jekyll project in 2022 with an M1 Macbook Pro is a pain. This is not the first time I have had issues setting it up in different kinds of machine. Because of this I plan to move away from Jekyll for a more stable development experience.

I will continue to update content since the CI/CD pipeline is already working.
