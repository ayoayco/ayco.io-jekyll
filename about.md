Hi! The content in this website is far from complete because it is quite new and I am only able to work on it in my very limited spare time. It will contain details of my [projects](/) and [talks](/talks), but if you want to read more of my works, I also have a [tech blog](https://fullhacker.com) and a [personal blog](https://blog.ayoayco.com).

I'm Ayo, a software engineer by profession who also occasionally *delves* into some art, music, literature...

I live in the Philippines with my wife, Jen, and our little boy, Kahel, with whom I often go travel around to take pictures, eat local delicacies, and make lots of fun memories.
