Hi! I'm Ayo, a software engineer by profession who also occasionally *delves* into some art, music, literature...

I live in the Philippines with my wife, Jen, and our little boy, Kahel, with whom I often go travel around to take pictures, eat local delicacies, and make lots of fun memories.

Here, I write notes on technology and life as I experience them hoping to help, if not inspire, others to live more efficient and happier lives...
