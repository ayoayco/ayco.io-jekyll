Obviously, this website is far from complete.

This is because it is quite new and I am only able to work on it in my very limited spare time.

However, when it is ready, it will contain details of my [projects](/), [talks](/talks), and some of my [notes](#).

If you want to read more of my works, I also have a [tech blog](https://fullhacker.com) and an outdated [personal blog](https://blog.ayoayco.com).

Oh and by the way, I'm Ayo, real name: Ramon Ayco Jr.

I am a software engineer by profession who also occasionally *delves* into some art, music, literature...

I live in the Philippines with my wife, Jen, and our little boy, Kahel, with whom I often go travel around to take pictures, eat local delicacies, and make lots of fun memories.
