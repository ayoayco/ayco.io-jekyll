# Angular Notes

[Angular](https://angular.io) is a framework for building frontend client apps for the web and mobile. It is "Opinionated" in the sense that it *forces* you to build your app in a way that is arguably strict.

Angular's version 2 and above radically changed the implementation of the first version, AngularJS. It steers away from the popular dev paradigm MVC and calls its framework MV\* (where * stands for *whatever*, i.e., Model-View-Whatever). This means that you can handle the Models in virtually whatever way you want.
