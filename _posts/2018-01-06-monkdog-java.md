The year was 2006. Or was it 2007? I'm not sure. I was but a sophomore student in the leading university for taking up Computer Science in the Philippines. No idea about what I wanted to do in life, but I knew I wanted to learn how computers work.

MonkDog is a turn-based game inspired by the classic Pokemon battle system.

I created the game using C as a project for the basic programming course I took as a sophomore Computer Science student.
