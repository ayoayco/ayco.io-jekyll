# Web Services

Web services make the front-end / back-end architecture possible, where most (if not all) business logic are separated from rendering the view. Here comes two popular types of Web APIs: REST and SOAP. REST, if I understand it correctly, can serve with any prototype such as HTTP or SMTP; while SOAP *is* a prototype particularly for XML-based exchange.

## REST APIs

REST APIs have become popular with the rise of JavaScript because it can data in JSON format, which is built in / native in JS, among other reasons. Many of today's most popular web applications provide Back-end API endpoints to provide integration capabilities for programmers.

## Micro-Services

Micro-services, in concept, are web services that are built independently to have virtually no effect on other features in the Web Application. Technologies should be independent from other services such that it is able to run fully whether the other services are running or not.
