# Open Source - Where to start?

I have been using open source since college, studying Computer Science, and I have released a number of projects over at [Github](http://github.com/ayoayco). But up until now, I have not contributed in any other open source project (except maybe that one time in college where we were required to do so...)

In this note I will document my journey into contributing to the open source community.


## Wet your apetite

Here is a list of communities/places/actions I have found over the web where I get my interest in open source all fired up.

1. [Reddit's r/opensource](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/) - To see what's the latest in the community.
2. [Github Trending](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rubik.github) - To browse through interesting repositories in Github.
3. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - To see what other developers are confused about... and sometimes to answer questions.
4. Open an account at [Github](https://github.com).
5. Read the [The Conscience of a Hacker](http://www.phrack.org/issues/7/3.html)
6. Read on [How To Become A Hacker](http://catb.org/%7Eesr/faqs/hacker-howto.html)
7. Install and play with a linux distribution (Ubuntu is a good starting point for me) [Ubuntu Homepage](https://ubuntu.com)
8. Publish [Notes](https://github.com/ayoayco/notes) at Github
